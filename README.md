# Statistics_in_biathlon
Repository for the final project of the course of Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis of the Physics of data master degree.
A Bayesian statistic analysis with R is performed on the biathlon word cup, starting from the 2014 season.

In the R-code directory we can find the R-markdowns where the actual code was developed.

The code for a dashboard built with dash is instead located in the dashboard directory.

The Biathlon_analysis.pdf document contains a brief recap of the analysis written in LaTex.
